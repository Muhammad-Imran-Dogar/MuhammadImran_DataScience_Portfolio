# Muhammad Imran - Mathematical Data Science Portfolio

Greetings from G√∂ttingen! I am Muhammad Imran, a proud Master‚Äôs candidate in Mathematical Data Science at the esteemed **Georg-August University of G√∂ttingen**, established in 1734 by King George II of Great Britain and Elector of Hanover. Renowned for its extraordinary legacy, G√∂ttingen boasts **47 Nobel laureates**‚Äîfrom pioneers like Max Born and Werner Heisenberg to modern trailblazers like Stefan Hell‚Äîwhose contributions have shaped science and humanity. As a student of this distinguished institution, I am inspired by its tradition of excellence to advance my work at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and emerging fields like quantum computing.

With over a decade of experience as a Mathematics and Computer Science Educator with the School Education Department, Punjab, Pakistan, and a BS (Hons) in Mathematics and Bachelor of Education from the University of Education, Lahore, I bring a unique blend of teaching expertise and technical proficiency. My current pursuits at G√∂ttingen include machine learning, deep learning (computer vision and NLP), data visualization, and optimization, all anchored by my deep knowledge of linear algebra, statistics, and computational methods. Recently, I‚Äôve engaged with cutting-edge topics, including an upcoming quantum computing workshop in Germany under the National High-Performance Computing (NHR) initiative in February 2025‚Äîfeaturing an introduction to quantum machine learning‚Äîand delivered a seminar talk on topological data analysis at my university.

This repository highlights my academic projects from my Master‚Äôs program at Georg-August University, practical applications from my teaching career, including lab-based computer science practicals I supervised, and my contributions to emerging fields. Explore below to see how I fuse educational insight with advanced data science and quantum technologies.
