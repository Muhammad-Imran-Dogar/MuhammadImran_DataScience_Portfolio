# Muhammad Imran - Mathematical Data Science Portfolio

Greetings from G√∂ttingen! I am Muhammad Imran, a proud Master‚Äôs candidate in Mathematical Data Science at the esteemed **Georg-August University of G√∂ttingen**, established in 1734 by King George II of Great Britain and Elector of Hanover. Renowned for its extraordinary legacy, G√∂ttingen boasts **47 Nobel laureates**‚Äîfrom pioneers like Max Born and Werner Heisenberg to modern trailblazers like Stefan Hell‚Äîwhose contributions have shaped science and humanity. As a student of this distinguished institution, I am inspired by its tradition of excellence to advance my work at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and emerging fields like quantum computing.

With over a decade of experience as a Mathematics and Computer Science Educator with the School Education Department, Punjab, Pakistan, and a BS (Hons) in Mathematics and Bachelor of Education from the University of Education, Lahore, I bring a unique blend of teaching expertise and technical proficiency. My current pursuits at G√∂ttingen include **machine learning**, **deep learning (computer vision and NLP)**, **data visualization**, and **optimization**, all anchored by my deep knowledge of linear algebra, statistics, and computational methods. I‚Äôve recently engaged with cutting-edge topics, including a completed *NHR Workshop on Quantum Computing for Scientific Research* in G√∂ttingen (2025), where I explored quantum simulation and **quantum machine learning** with tools like **Qiskit** and **PennyLane**, and delivered a seminar talk on **topological data analysis** at my university in 2024.

This repository highlights my academic projects from my Master‚Äôs program, practical applications from my teaching career‚Äîincluding lab-based computer science practicals I supervised‚Äîand my contributions to emerging fields. Explore below to see how I fuse educational insight with advanced data science and quantum technologies.
